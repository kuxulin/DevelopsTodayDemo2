For correct work create .env file in project folder with variables API and CURRENT_YEAR
Project is configured to use custom webpack in order to be able to use data from .env

App uses reactive approach to show countries and holidays
Had some problems with showing 3 random countries, so approach is not so reactive there)

Angular Material was used with packages like dotenv, custom-webpack, types/node for .env
